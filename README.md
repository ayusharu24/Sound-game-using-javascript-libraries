# Sound-game-using-javascript-libraries
I have made a game using two JavaScript libraries Paper.js and Howler.js . Paper.js is mainly used for animation and graphics whereas howler.js is used for sounds and audio. I have added 26 sounds in an object where every alphabet is assigned an audio and whenever any of the alphabet key is pressed a unique sound is played with a different animation.
